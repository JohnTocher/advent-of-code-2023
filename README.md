# advent-of-code-2023

Repository for shared solutions of AoC 2023! This year *will* (might) be different!

## Solutions in python with an educational focus

The code and documentation here are based around python solutions for the online advent-of-code project.
https://adventofcode.com/2023/

This documentation is meant to assist with using the challenges for educational purposes, probably augmented by real-world sessions.
Hopefully you've received a message or chatted to me personally about this and know exactly what it's all about.

You should be able to clone/download this repository and be able to work on the puzzles locally without a live internet connection.  
I will downloaded the dataset into the folder for each puzzle so your dont have to, that's not really a part of the problem, although downloading data from web sites may well be something we get into at some point.

If not, you're still welcome to everything here, but please refer to the original site to see what it's all about.
This is not meant to be a showcase of the most ingenious, elegant or correct solutions, rather it's a resource to introduce python and the related software development toos to those without a development background.

You probably want to start with the .md file in each puzzle subfolder.  If folder "N: isn't here yet and it's already day N+x that's just because I'm slack and/or busy!

## What you need

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), any current version of python 3, which is 3.8 or later.  If you're on linux (ubuntu, or a raspberry pi), the command to run the scripts will probably be ```python3 filename.py``` rather than ```python filename.py```  
- Your favourite text editor.  I usually use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), but you can use whatever you prefer.

All my solutions will be presented in python, but you can of course use something else.  Bash, C/C++, one of the javascripts, Arduino, assembler, or even [butterflies](https://xkcd.com/378/).  Some of these tools are probably better than others, but I'm not here to judge.  You can use the datasets, or anything else here as suits.

*Note:* You probably *can't* do this on a vanilla SOE box, although if you really want to, come and see me and we can sort that out too.  Getting python to run pretty much anywhere else should be straightforward, but again reach out if you run into any grief.

Current status: Waiting for the 2023 session to kick off
