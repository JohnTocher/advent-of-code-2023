# advent-of-code-2023

Repository for shared solutions of AoC 2023! This year *will* (might) be different!

## Solutions in python with an educational focus

The code and documentation here are based around python solutions for the online advent-of-code project.
https://adventofcode.com/2023/

This documentation is meant to assist with using the challenges for educational purposes, probably augmented by real-world sessions.
Hopefully you've received a message or chatted to me personally about this and know exactly what it's all about.

You should be able to clone/download this repository and be able to work on the puzzles locally without a live internet connection.  
I will downloaded the dataset into the folder for each puzzle so your dont have to, that's not really a part of the problem, although downloading data from web sites may well be something we get into at some point.

If not, you're still welcome to everything here, but please refer to the original site to see what it's all about.
This is not meant to be a showcase of the most ingenious, elegant or correct solutions, rather it's a resource to introduce python and the related software development toos to those without a development background.

You probably want to start with the .md file in each puzzle subfolder.  If folder "N: isn't here yet and it's already day N+x that's just because I'm slack and/or busy!

## What you need

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), any current version of python 3, which is 3.8 or later.  If you're on linux (ubuntu, or a raspberry pi), the command to run the scripts will probably be ```python3 filename.py``` rather than ```python filename.py```  
- Your favourite text editor.  I usually use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), but you can use whatever you prefer.

All my solutions will be presented in python, but you can of course use something else.  Bash, C/C++, one of the javascripts, Arduino, assembler, or even [butterflies](https://xkcd.com/378/).  Some of these tools are probably better than others, but I'm not here to judge.  You can use the datasets, or anything else here as suits.

*Note:* You probably *can't* do this on a vanilla SOE box, although if you really want to, come and see me and we can sort that out too.  Getting python to run pretty much anywhere else should be straightforward, but again reach out if you run into any grief.

## How I can help

Once I start a puzzle, I will upload the input data as a file you should be able to use to work on your solution. While this is often fairly trivial, it's one less thing you have to do, and reduces the chance of a simple transcription error ruining your day.

It's important ot note, though, if you test your code against my data, you will be getting the results for my data, which won't get you your your stars on the AoC web site, and unlock the next puzzle.  I'll provide my expected output, so you can keep going, but if you want to progress on the official site, you'll have to submit the correct response calculated against your own data.  Let me know if this is unclear, and I'll walk you through it.  Essentially you have to save the data provided on the web site for your login to a text file, and run your code against that.  The "sample" data sets should be the same for everyone, and are a good sanity check.

I've also created a "starter" solution, which provides a basic template for at least starting to process the data.  It doesn't solve the problem, and has no real spoilers, so feel free to use that as a starting point, especially if python isn't your usual tool for this sort of thing, or you're at a loss as to how to get started.

You certainly don't need to use my template, and there is no guarantee my solution will be the ideal, most efficient, or otherwise "best" solution, but I am trying to make them comprehensible.

## How you can help

Have a go.  Get involved in the discussions.  I don't mind being told something is a bad idea, or given a better alternative, just don't be a tool about it ;p

There is a "Discussions" option right near the top of the GitHub web page for the repo. Or just [click here](https://github.com/JohnTocher/advent-of-code-2023/discussions).

## Current status

Puzzle 05 part 1 complete, part 2 not yet attempted
Templates uploaded up to Day 08, but I'll be a little bit off-line for a day or two, aiming to catch up on the weekend.
